# Nuke-Following-Twitter-

This script is designed to unfollow multiple users on a social media platform automatically. It is built using JavaScript and can be executed in the browser's console.

Usage
Open the developer console in your web browser.
Copy the entire script from the provided code and paste it into the console.
Press Enter to run the script.
Caution: Please use this script responsibly and be aware of the platform's terms of service. Misuse of this script may violate the platform's guidelines.

How it Works
The script continuously scrolls down the page to load more users, unfollows them, and then repeats the process until no more follow buttons are found. It includes a retry mechanism to ensure all users are unfollowed, even if the initial attempt doesn't capture all.
